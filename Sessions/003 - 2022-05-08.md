## Recoup and resupply
[[Helgot]] spends a few days in the Flash and Scroll inn, tending his wounds and considering his next move. His morale is low; though he spent time exploring the first floor, he feels no closer to finding the *Exarchate of Theana* for [[Jasper]], and has become convinced tackling the vastness of Dwimmermount is a far greater quest than he feels capable of achieving by himself.

> Sojourn: weak hit with bond, +2 health, +2 spirit

He swears an iron vow to found a proper adventuring party to better tackle the imposing megadungeon. He wants Jasper's help, and to gather around him like-minded adventurers, treaser-seekers and loremasters. They will be *The Ironsworn*. 

However, he decides, he would have better luck convincing Jasper of this course of action should he return to [[The City-State of Adamas]] successful, with the map in hand.

> Swear an Iron Vow: miss, -2 momentum

Depressingly, rumors abound of another adventuring party, styling themselves *[[NPCs/Typhon's Fists|Typhons' Fists]]*, who have been bragging about the progess they've made delving Dwimmermount on behalf of the High Priest of Typhon in Adamas. Helgot hasn't yet come across them in Muntberg, but surely it is only a matter of time. 

> Gather information, strong hit, +2 momentum

He asks around the inns to see if anyone knows them and discovers some promising information -- they're currently making their way back to Adamas to report their findings, so they are, temporarily at least, out of the picture.

## Back into Dwimmermount
It seems there is nothing to do but head back into Dwimmermount and continue searching for the map. Returning it to Jasper would not only fulful an iron vow, but seems the best way to convince him to continue funding a group to explore the rest of the site. Helgot readies his gear and sets out. 

The short journey back to the base of the mountain, and then the trek back up the stairs is uneventful, though Helgot does find the Red Doors ajar when arriving -- perhaps someone (or something?) has recently passed through. Cautiously, he ducks inside and heads up to the entrance chamber, wary that last time he was here a patroling metallic skeleton had been present. 

> Delve the Depths of Dwimmermount, weak hit

Helgot's plan was to this time head through the doors immediately in front of him, but he finds his way barred -- the doors are guarded by a pair of pig-faced orcs, who bistle and ready their weapons at he comes into view. 

>trade blows but helgot clearly outclassing them
eventually win with a weak hit, endure harm

...

The doors swing open to reveal a long, wide corridor, at the centre of which is a circular area where a second corridor intersects. In the middle, a plinth supports a huge mable statue of Mavor, the god of War, holdiing a shield and barbed spear. The head, however, is clearly Turms Temax.

Including the doors through which he entered, there are four exit doorways, one in each cardinal direction. The doors to the east are the most unusual, made of white nephelite -- a pearlesent, smooth material, cool to the touch -- and covered with soot and grit. They also prove impossible to open -- perhaps even magically sealed. 

The passages to the north and south are much more mundane. Helgot decides to try north, having largely travelled south on his last visit.

Cautiously creeps along corridor to north. There are closed doors at the end of the corridor, two sets on the left, and one on the right. Helgot decides to try the nearest door, one of the ones on the right. It leads to...

### The laboratory
The room is dominated by a long, steel-reinforced oak table, stained in a variety of colors. The  walls are criss-crossed with iron shelves, all empty, though many are stained like the table. The floor is covered in smashed glass and scattered with broken and rotten wooden chairs and crates. Helgot picks through the debris, but finds nothing of use -- the place has been ransacked.

This abandoned laboratory also offers a further two exits, to the north and to the east. Before he can really decide what to do next, the door on the east wall swings open and a pair of kobolds bound into the room, branishing swords, with another three behind them.

> Kobolds are short, dog-like humanoids with cowardly and sadistic tendencies. A kobold's scaly skin ranges from dark rusty brown to a rusty black color. It has glowing red eyes. Kobolds wear ragged clothing, favoring red and orange. A kobold is 2 to 2 Â½ feet tall.

They bark and shout in their native language, unintelligable, but one phrase is repeated over and over in their calls: *Arach-Nacha!* *Arach-Nacha!*

> Battle, weak hit. Endure harm, miss, marked wounded

The last of the kobolds flee away to the west, screaming, and again the words *Arach-Nacha!* are repeated. Helgot slumps to ground, gravely wounded. He rummages through his pack to gather some bandages and alcohol, and patches himself up.
