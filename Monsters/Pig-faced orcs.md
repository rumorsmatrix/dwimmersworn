Orcs prefer wearing vivid colors that many humans would consider unpleasant, such as blood red, mustard yellow, yellow-green, and deep purple. Their equipment is dirty and unkempt. An adult male orc is a little over 6 feet tall and females are slightly smaller. Orcs are primarily subterranean, but they are also nocturnal and may be found on the surface at night.
