# ![[HumM169_lg.png]] Jasper
Jasper is a sage and alchemist. His place of business is next door to a candle shop in the [[The City-State of Adamas]]' market district. 

[[Bishop Saidon]], who is obsessed with spoons and other ancient curios, is Jasper’s most profitable customer.  


## Currently unknown facts
- Many of the city’s adventurers and mages  consult with him on azoth.
- Jasper calls azoth “philosopher’s mercury,” a rare element he believes to be a distillation of magic itself and a key ingredient in transmuting base materials into higher ones.
- Because adventurers seeking to sell or appraise samples of azoth are likely to wind up at Jasper’s shop, it is closely watched by several groups of Termaxian cultists.
- Jasper is aware that he is watched, and has grown increasingly paranoid. He protects his inner office with a door trap that drops a bucket of acid on unwary intruders.
