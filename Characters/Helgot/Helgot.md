  * Iron: *Strike* (if you have initiative) or *Clash* now, and add +1.
  * Edge: Take +1 momentum.
- [ ] When you *Strike* in close combat, you may attempt to drive your spear home (decide before rolling). If you do, add +1 and inflict +2 harm on a hit. If you score a hit and the fight continues, *Face Danger* +iron to recover your spear.
