## The City-State of Adamas
Founded as Fort Adamantas during Thulian times, the city-state now known as Adamas is the largest bastion of men in the North. Its despot, [[NPCs/Mahe Cheron|Mahe Cheron]], rules over a realm that encompasses 88 6-mile hexes and 51,785 families (over a quarter-million people).

## Background
The city’s garrison includes 120 heavy cavalry, 180 light cavalry, 240 crossbowmen, 480 heavy infantry, and 480 light infantry, under the command of the despot, 3 mercenary captains (eacha 7th level fighter), and 11 lieutenants (each a 5th level fighter). Adamas also subsidizes the troops at Muntburg (2,500gp/month) and Fort Aster (1,450 gp/month).

The despot’s rule, though harsh, commands the support of the temples of Typhon and Tyche, both of which recognize that the need for stability outweighs other considerations when so many beastmen and monsters threaten civilization in the region.

The temple of Tyche has a mostly female hierarchy who are popularly believed to be flighty and unreliable due to their dedication to the workings of chance. The temple of Typhon demands unforgiving discipline, but remains popular because it has a history of defending Adamas and other bastions of Law in times of need.
