# 1.1 Entrance Chamber
Ancient and smooth-worn stairs descend from the Red Doors into the entrance chamber of Dwimmermount. The room contains five doors (two of them side by side) and six marble statues. All of the doors are made of hard oak, reinforced with steel, and none are locked. Five of the six statues depict distinct male figures in different poses, wearing archaic Thulian dress, but all with the exact same head and face — that of a haughty, bearded manwith piercing eyes. Clerics and others with religious knowledge may recognize five of the figures as representations of Thulians gods ([[Caint]], [[Dorn]],[[Mavors]], [[Tenen]], and [[Typhon]]), and the identical heads as being that of [[Turms Termax]]. These heads are not original to the statues and can be removed with a successful force doors roll (seeChapter 6, Overview of the Dungeon, p. 73, for more information on these removable heads and the boons that can be gained by replacing them with the original). The sixth statue depicts an attractive, but hard-faced woman in plain garb. This is [[Sarana]], Turms’ lover, who legends say disappeared shortly before his apotheosis.
