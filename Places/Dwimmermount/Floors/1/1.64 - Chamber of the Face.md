This large room once contained several rows ofwooden benches bolted to the floor. Some of them have since been removed, but two remain and are in remarkably good condition. On the northern wall of the room is a sculpture of a bearded man’s face made from rusty metal. If anyone gets within 5 feet of the face, its mouth begins to move slightly and unintelligible sounds begin to emanate from it. Should anyone apply oil, grease, or some other lubricant to the corners of the face’s mouth, it opens more widely and speaks clearly in High Thulian. 

"Ask a question, if you have one. I’ll answer truthfully, but then you’re done."

Should a character actually question the face in High Thulian, the face will answer truthfully to the best of its knowledge. The face will only answer one question per character. The face knows only about this level of Dwimmermount and its information is out of date, so the Judge should bear this in mind when crafting a reply. If the face does not know the answer to a question posed, it will admit as such, but such a question still counts as the one it will answer for that character. If asked any more questions after the first, it will reply, again in High Thulian, "Go away; I shall not answer you again today." A character can query the face again after 24 hours have elapsed.
