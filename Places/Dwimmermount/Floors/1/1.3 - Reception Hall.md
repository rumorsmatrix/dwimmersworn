# Reception Hall
This large room contains the remains of smashed wooden tables and chairs. Before the sealing of Dwimmermount, this place had been a hall for the reception of Thulian dignitaries and other guests of high rank, as evidenced by the faded frescoes and tattered tapestries on the walls. Currently, the hall serves as the temporary home for a scouting party of seven recently spawned orcs that have made their way to this level from The Laboratory (Level 2A).
