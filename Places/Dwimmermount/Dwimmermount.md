# Dwimmermount
Dwimmermount is located a few miles to the northwest of the fortified town of [[Muntberg]]. Dwimmermount was excavated from the tallest mountain in the Wintertop range and is reputed to have at least half a dozen levels, if not double that number.

## Locations

## Background
The dungeon was the site for the most important magical research of past eras, including investigations into time, space, and the creation of life. For hundreds — maybe thousands — of years, Dwimmermount served as a fortress for a succession of empires. It fell two centuries ago, when a rebel uprising culminated in a mysterious cataclysm that sealed the dungeon off from the outside world. Many of the inhabitants of [[Muntberg]] and the nearby region known as the City-States are there to keep an eye on Dwimmermount. Some hope to enter the dungeon to get rich, others to free one of the powerful beings which the local authorities hope will remain locked away in Dwimmermount’s extra-dimensional prison.

Within the last few weeks, rumors have begun to circulate that the magical wards that once sealed off Dwimmermount have fallen. Shadowy figures are reportedly going into, and coming out of, the mountain fortress.
