# Muntberg
THE FORTIFIED TOWN OF MUNTBURG (meaning “mountaincastle” in a now-obscure local language) was built during Thulian times to guard the trade route through the Wintertops, at the other end of which lay [[Places/Winterburg|Winterburg]]. Of relatively minor importance in those days, Muntburg has grown considerably since the fall of the Empire.

Now under the authority of the [[The City-State of Adamas]], Muntburg still guards the trade route (which is considerably less active than it once was), but its primary purpose is to keep an eye on [[Dwimmermount]] and the adventurers and cultists that are drawn to the ancient citadel.


## The Flask and Scroll Tavern
Run by [[NPCs/Macyot|Macyot]] and his family (wife, two sons, and a daughter), the Flask and Scroll Tavern is open day and night and is usually bustling with activity. Both travelers and regular residents of Muntburg come here for good food and drink, as well as to socialize and swap stories.
