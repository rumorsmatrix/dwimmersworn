# Theme: Fortified
A fortified site is held and defendedby an enemy force. It might be an enemy camp, an outpost, a fortress,or a closely-guarded territory. 

Infiltrating this place requires caution and cunning. You maybe forced to avoid inhabitants, sentries, and patrols. Revealing yourself or causing a disturbance will catch the attention of the denizens, perhaps forcing you to fight your way to your objective.
