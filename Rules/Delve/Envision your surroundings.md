# Envision your surroundings
When you make the [[Moves#Delve the Depths]] move, the first step is to define the characteristics of the area you are attempting to traverse. You are moving from a known area (your current location), into an unknown area. What will you find there? Taking a moment to reveal the characteristics of an area will create context for your exploration and the result of your moves.

Have a look at your theme and domain cards. They both include a feature table. When you want to define the characteristics of an area, you may Ask the Oracle using these tables as inspiration. 

When you make a standard 1-100 oracle roll, the possible results span both cards. If you roll 1-20, refer to the theme card for your answer. 21-100 is found on the domain card.
