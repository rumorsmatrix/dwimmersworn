To determine the outcome of your move, compare the action score to each of the challenge dice. You want it to be greater than the individual value of those dice.

## Matches
When you roll for a move, you should be on the lookout for amatch on the challenge dice. In cooperative and solo play, this is your trigger to add a twist, createa new complication, or otherwise mix things up. Something interesting, unexpected, or unusual happens. If you’re unsure, you Ask the Oracle, which is a move you use to ask questions or check for inspiration.

The outcome of a match should be evaluated based on the result of your move:
- Strong hit: The match should represent a twist in the narrative, something interesting, or a new opportunity
- Miss: The match should represent a heightened negative outcome, a complication, or new danger. Things get worse for you in an unexpected way.

You can also let the intensity of your success or failure frame how you interpret a match. Rolling matched 10’s on your challenge dice should prompt you to introduce a harrowing turn of events or a dire failure. It’s as bad as things get.
